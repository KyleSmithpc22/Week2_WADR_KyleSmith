                    Synopsis: When tyrannical dictator Joseph Stalin dies in 1953,
                    his parasitic cronies square off in a frantic power struggle to become the next Soviet leader.
                    Among the contenders are the dweebish Georgy Malenkov,
                    the wily Nikita Khrushchev and Lavrenti Beria -- the sadistic secret police chief.
                    As they bumble, brawl and back-stab their way to the top,
                    the question remains -- just who is running the government?
